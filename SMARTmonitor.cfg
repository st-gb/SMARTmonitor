#	Name="raw-read-error-rate";
#	Details="Quantity of uncorrectable errors. The raw value of this attribute indicates the total number of uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector. A rise in the value of this attribute indicates that there are evident defects of the disk surface and/or there are problems in the hard disk drive mechanical subsystem.";

	{ Id=5;
	Name="reallocated-sector-count";
	Critical="yes";
	Details="Count of reallocated sectors. When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it marks this sector as \"reallocated\" and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area).
	This process is also known as remapping and \"reallocated\" sectors are called remaps. This is why, on a modern hard disks, you can not see \"bad blocks\" while testing the surface - all bad blocks are hidden in reallocated sectors. However, the more sectors that are reallocated, the more a sudden decrease (up to 10% and more) can be noticed in the disk read/write speed.";

	{ Id=9;
	Name="Power-On Hours";
	Details="Count of hours in power-on state. 
         The raw value of this attribute shows total count of hours (or minutes, or seconds, depending on manufacturer) in power-on state.";

	Details="Count of remap operations (transfering data from a bad sector to a special reserved disk area - spare area).
The raw value of this attribute shows the total number of attempts to transfer data from reallocated sectors to a spare area. Unsuccessful attempts are counted as well as successful.";

	Name="current-pending-sector";
	Critical="yes";
	Details="Current count of unstable sectors (waiting for remapping). The raw value of this attribute indicates the total number of sectors waiting for remapping. Later, when some of these sectors are read successfully, the value is decreased. If errors still occur when reading some sector, the hard drive will try to restore the data, transfer it to the reserved disk area (spare area) and mark this sector as remapped. If this attribute value remains at zero, it indicates that the quality of the corresponding surface area is low.";

	Name="uncorrectable-sector-count";

	Details="This attribute value depends of read errors, disk surface condition and indicates the rate of hardware read errors that occurred when reading data from a disk surface. Lower values indicate that there is a problem with either disk surface or read/write heads";

NOTE: Shift of disks is possible as a result of a strong shock or a fall, or for other reasons.";
