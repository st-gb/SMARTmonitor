S.M.A.R.T. monitor (2021 version) features and limitations
===========================================

S.M.A.R.T. (only) directly via ATA/IDE standard.
Not possible/tested via USB (adapter/bridge) inbetween.

Implemented to function with multiple data carriers but only tested with 1.

possible unwanted behaviour:
---------------------------
The (wxWidgets) client is stuck at "reading number of bytes for S.M.A.R.T. data"
when the host/computer of the server hangs/is shut down.
Then in wxWidgets GUI one has to press the "Disconnect" button.
