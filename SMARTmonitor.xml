 <SMART_parameters> 
  <SMART_parameter Id="1" Name="Read Error Rate"
	Details="Quantity of uncorrectable errors. The raw value of this attribute indicates the total number of uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector. A rise in the value of this attribute indicates that there are evident defects of the disk surface and/or there are problems in the hard disk drive mechanical subsystem." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="2" Name="Throughput Performance" />
  <SMART_parameter Id="3" Name="Spin-Up Time" />
  <SMART_parameter Id="4" Name="Start/Stop Count" Details="A tally of spindle start/stop cycles. The spindle turns on, and hence the count is increased, both when the hard disk is turned on after having before been turned entirely off (disconnected from power source) and when the hard disk returns from having previously been put to sleep mode." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="5" Name="Reallocated Sectors Count" Critical="yes" Details="Count of reallocated sectors. When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it marks this sector as reallocated and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area).
	This process is also known as remapping and reallocated sectors are called remaps. This is why, on a modern hard disks, you can not see bad blocks while testing the surface - all bad blocks are hidden in reallocated sectors. However, the more sectors that are reallocated, the more a sudden decrease (up to 10% and more) can be noticed in the disk read/write speed." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="6" Name="Read Channel Margin" Details="Margin of a channel while reading data. The function of this attribute is not specified." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="7" Name="Seek Error Rate" Details="(Vendor specific raw value.) Rate of seek errors of the magnetic heads. If there is a partial failure in the mechanical positioning system, then seek errors will arise. Such a failure may be due to numerous factors, such as damage to a servo, or thermal widening of the hard disk. The raw value has different structure for different vendors and is often not meaningful as a decimal number." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="8" Name="Seek Time Performances" Details="Average performance of seek operations of the magnetic heads. If this attribute is decreasing, it is a sign of problems in the mechanical subsystem." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="9" Name="Power-On Time" Details="Count of hours in power-on state. 
   The raw value of this attribute shows total count of hours (or minutes, or seconds, depending on manufacturer) in power-on state." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="10" Name="Spin Retry Count" Details="Count of retry of spin start attempts. This attribute stores a total count of the spin start attempts to reach the fully operational speed (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). An increase of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="11" Name="Recalibration Retries or Calibration Retry Count" Details="This attribute indicates the count that recalibration was requested (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). An increase of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="12" Name="Power Cycle Count" Details="This attribute indicates the count of full hard disk power on/off cycles." />

  <SMART_parameter Id="196" Name="Reallocation Event Count" Critical="yes" Details="Count of remap operations (transfering data from a bad sector to a special reserved disk area - spare area).
The raw value of this attribute shows the total number of attempts to transfer data from reallocated sectors to a spare area. Unsuccessful attempts are counted as well as successful." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="197" Name="Current Pending Sector Count" Critical="yes" Details="Current count of unstable sectors (waiting for remapping). The raw value of this attribute indicates the total number of sectors waiting for remapping. Later, when some of these sectors are read successfully, the value is decreased. If errors still occur when reading some sector, the hard drive will try to restore the data, transfer it to the reserved disk area (spare area) and mark this sector as remapped. If this attribute value remains at zero, it indicates that the quality of the corresponding surface area is low." />
  <SMART_parameter Id="198" Name="Uncorrectable Sector Count" Critical="yes" Details="This attribute value depends of read errors, disk surface condition and indicates the rate of hardware read errors that occurred when reading data from a disk surface.
